# Big O Cheat Sheet:

### Big Os

**O(1)** _Constant_- no loops
**O(log N)** _Logarithmic_- usually searching algorithms have log n if they are sorted (Binary Search)
**O(n)** _Linear_- for loops, while loops through n items
**O(n log(n))** _Log Linear_- usually sorting operations
**O(n^2)** _Quadratic_- every element in a collection needs to be compared to ever other element. Two
nested loops
**O(2^n)** _Exponential_- recursive algorithms that solves a problem of size N
**O(n!)** _Factorial_- you are adding a loop for every element

_Iterating through half a collection is still O(n)_
_Two separate collections: O(a \* b)_
